# Company test
 
Welcome to my job search repository! Here, you will find a collection of the various tests and in-home assessments that I have completed as part of my journey to find a new job.

The repository is organized by company, with each folder containing the relevant materials for the tests and assessments that I completed for that company. Some folders may contain a mix of written materials (such as coding challenges or case studies) and recorded materials (such as video interviews or screencasts).

I hope that this repository serves as a useful resource for other job seekers, as well as a portfolio of my skills and experience. Thank you for visiting!
