# Job Search Tests
 
Welcome to my job search repository! Here, you will find a collection of the various tests and in-home assessments that I have completed as part of my journey to find a new job.
The repository is organized by company, with each folder containing the relevant materials for the tests and assessments that I completed for that company. Some folders may contain a mix of written materials (such as coding challenges or case studies) and recorded materials (such as video interviews or screencasts).

WARNING!!!
This repository is private, if you can see this readme it might be a signal that you are going to hire me on the spot! Please review the shared code, thanks for the opportunity!
